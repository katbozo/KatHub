# KatHub
Welcome!
KatHub is a Roblox lua script that supports many games.  
    Please head to https://github.com/katbozo/KatHub/blob/main/Info.md to learn more!

# FAQ
Will i get banned for using KatHub?    
    No, I make sure that all my scripts are as safe as possible to avoid any risk of ban. You may use an alt if you're worried!

KatHub not working?    
    Make sure it is a game that KatHub supports and the executor you're using is good

Why are the source code obfuscated?    
    Mostly, to avoid game devs from easily patching a script or overall reduce the risk of getting banned. I can assure you that none of my scripts have any harmful functions!
